# What-happened-to-livetrack.io-

6.12.2019

Livetrack.io fitted perfectly to IpBike. I don t know any other application appart from Garmin connect mobile which would be suitable for a live-tracking service.

There is another live-streaming service available now from Dave Does Demos called IoT streaming:

A solution like Dave Does Demos looks promising.

Disadvantages of  IoT streaming: :

- It only works with newer GARMIN watches
- fee necessary for Microsoft Azure Cloud service
- software developement is necessary in the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform
- no GPS

I first contacted Nils Knielings about the subject of MATLAB and  livetrack.io. I asked him whether it was possible to  use livetrack.io for streaming to MATLAB.

He answered me that he does not know MATLAB, but that this should work.

I then started a post in the THIS IS ANT FORUM:

https://www.thisisant.com/forum/viewthread/7074/

Nils Knielings is founder of the organization livetrack.io. He stopped livetrack.io as a reaction on my posts in the THIS IS ANT forum, I suppose. 

- I asked in the forum, to bring livetrack.io back, but there was no reaction
- I contacted Nils Knielings by e-mail for a solution of this problem, but there was no reaction

- I asked Nils Knielings whether he could integrate livetrack.io into VELO HERO, and I told him I would be ready to pay the abo for VELO
  HERO when he integrated livetrack.io in VELO HERO. But he answered me, that he had no plans to do that.
  
- I wrote an issue on GITHUB about solving the problem of closing the site livetrack.io. After I wrote that issue it suddenly was not
  possible to write issues anymore on Cyclenerd (Nils)GitHub anymore, and my issue was gone.

- Nils Knielings  livetrack.io, or something similar to that service, would be great as a project for livetracking and also to stream  
  sensor data to MATLAB

- In the configuration of livetracking.io which I tested, when it was still running, every MATLAB user would have been
  able to stream over his service to MATLAB with IpBike, I suppose.

  I don t know the reason why Nils Knielings stopped livetrack.io.

- Reasons could be that he did not wanted that MATLAB users stream over his service. 

- That the service was not designed for Matlab users
- that he had no time for developement
- or other reasons

- In the description of livetracking.io Nils Knieling mentioned that developers are welcome.

- Anyone who is interested in solving these problems is welcome here in this project (send an e-mail to peter.gamma.2019@gmail.com).
