# What-happened-to-livetrack.io-

6.12.2019

Livetrack.io fitted perfectly to IpBike. I don t know any other application appart from Garmin connect mobile which would be suitable for a live-tracking service.

There is another live-streaming service available now from Dave Does Demos called IoT streaming:

A solution like Dave Does Demos looks promising.

Disadvantages of  IoT streaming: :

- It only works with newer GARMIN watches
- fee necessary for Microsoft Azure Cloud service
- software developement is necessary in the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform
- no GPS

I first contacted Nils Knielings about the subject of MATLAB and  livetrack.io. I asked him whether it was possible to  use livetrack.io for streaming to MATLAB.

He answered me that he does not know MATLAB, but that this should work.

I then started a post in the THIS IS ANT FORUM:

https://www.thisisant.com/forum/viewthread/7074/

Nils Knielings is founder of the organization livetrack.io. He stopped livetrack.io as a reaction on my posts in the THIS IS ANT forum, I suppose. 

- I asked in the forum, to bring livetrack.io back, but there was no reaction
- I contacted Nils Knielings by e-mail for a solution of this problem, but there was no reaction

- I asked Nils Knielings whether he could integrate livetrack.io into VELO HERO, and I told him I would be ready to pay the abo for VELO
  HERO when he integrated livetrack.io in VELO HERO. But he answered me, that he had no plans to do that.
  
- I wrote an issue on GITHUB about solving the problem of closing the site livetrack.io. After I wrote that issue it suddenly was not
  possible to write issues anymore on Cyclenerd (Nils)GitHub anymore, and my issue was gone.

- Nils Knielings  livetrack.io, or something similar to that service, would be great as a project for livetracking and also to stream  
  sensor data to MATLAB

- In the configuration of livetracking.io which I tested, when it was still running, every MATLAB user would have been
  able to stream over his service to MATLAB with IpBike, I suppose.

  I don t know the reason why Nils Knielings stopped livetrack.io.

- Reasons could be that he did not wanted that MATLAB users stream over his service. 

- That the service was not designed for Matlab users
- that he had no time for developement
- or other reasons

- In the description of livetracking.io Nils Knieling mentioned that developers are welcome.

- Anyone who is interested in solving these problems is welcome here in this project (send an e-mail to peter.gamma.2019@gmail.com).

Alternatives

1. To find a person who can communicate with Nils Knieling, convince him to bring it back, help him to debug the project when It is buggy, or convince him to offer a product

https://github.com/Cyclenerd

2. Integration of the MQQT path into IpBike, join the feature request discussion

4. Developement of the MQQT path over Rasperri PI or Pinephone, Community project in the THIS IS ANT Forum

https://www.thisisant.com/forum/viewthread/7362/

5. Join the discussion to find a path for streaming bluetooth smart sensors like Polar OH1 and Stryd Foot Pod

6. Bluetooth smart streaming solution:

a) trying to find friends for this solution in the mind monitor forum:

https://mind-monitor.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1116

b) trying to find fiends for this path in the Bitalino  forum:

https://forum.bitalino.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=610

c) BLEv5.0 example code in Matlab

Someone already developed an example of BLE devices with Heart Rate Profile using the GATT client-server scenario as specified in the Bluetooth Core Specification v5.0, Dec. 06, 2016 in Matlab

https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/examples/modeling-of-ble-devices-with-heart-rate-profile.html

Unfortunately, there is no example code for a specific watch available for this example to this date
