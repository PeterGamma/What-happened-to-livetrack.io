What happened  to livetrack.io?

Is there a developer who can convince Nils Knieling to bring livetrack.io back to live again? It fitted perfectly to IpBike. I don t know any other application appart from Garmin connect mobile from GARMIN which is controlled by GARMIN which would be suitable for a live-tracking service.

There is another live-streaming service available now from Dave Does Demos called IoT
streaming:

Disadvantages of  IoT streaming: :

- only works with newer GARMIN watches
- fee necessary for Microsoft Azure Cloud service
- software developement for  IoT streaming could eventually be difficult
- no GPS

I first contacted Nils Knielings about the subject of MATLAB and  livetrack.io. I asked him whether it was possible to  use livetrack.io for streaming to MATLAB.

He answered me that he does not know MATLAB, but that this should work.

I started a post in the THIS IS ANT FORUM:

https://www.thisisant.com/forum/viewthread/7074/

Nils Knielings is founder of the organization livetrack.io. He stopped livetrack.io as a reaction on my posts in the THIS IS ANT forum. 

- I asked in the forum, to bring livetrack.io back, but there was no reaction
- I contacted Nils Knielings by e-mail for a solution of this problem, but there was no reaction
- I asked Nils Knielings whether he could integrate  livetrack.io into VELO HERO, and I told him I would be ready to pay the abo for VELO HERO when he integrated  livetrack.io. But he answered me, that he had no plans to do that.
- I wrote an issue on my GITHUB about closing the site livetrack.io. After I wrote that issue it suddenly was not possible to write  issues anymore on Cyclenerd (Nils) Â· GitHub anymore.

- I m not a software developer. I normally  don t code, but I m expierenced in scrypting and debugging.

- Nils Knielings  livetrack.io, or something similar to that service, would be great as a project for  livetracking and also to stream sensor data to MATLAB

- in the configuration of the livetracking.io, as it was when it was still running, in my view, every MATLAB user would have been able to stream over his service to MATLAB with  IpBike.

I don t know the reason why Nils Knielings stopped  livetrack.io.

- Reasons could be that he did not wanted that MATLAB users stream over his service. 

- That the service was not designed for Matlab users
- that he had no time for developement
- or other reasons

- I m not a developer, I normally don t code, and I m not experienced with GITHUB.

- anyone who is intersted in bringing livetrack.io back is welcome to this project.
